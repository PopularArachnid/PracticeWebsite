	<p style="text-align: center">The purpose of this website is for me, Sam Hovland, to practice what I've been taught in my college courses. I'm currentlying learning about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'll go over what I've learned so far, what I think I can improve on, and what I plan to learn, in the future. </p>
	</div>	
<!--	<h2 style="text-align: center">What I plan on learning</h2>
 	<p>With HTML I hope to become more proficient when it comes to using tags, IDs, and Classes. Also, making sure that the website is accessable for everybody.
		I want to plan improving my CSS skills as well. The box model is a big part of CSS, and we haven't covered it all in class, yet.. I do believe Bootstrap is going to be a big part of the box model as well. Along with improving my skills with the box model, I wish to get better at using selectors. Specifically Group, Decendant, Child, Adjacent Sibling, General Sibling, ID, Class, and Universal selectors. </p> -->
