	<h2>What I know:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Making a basic stylesheet for CSS and learning the syntax.</li>
		<LI>Changing the size, color, weight, emphasis, and spacing of the text.</LI>
		<li>Altering the indents of paragraphs.</li>
		<li>Understanding selectors in CSS, such as: contextual, and so on</li>
		<li>There is a hierarchy of importance when it comes to CSS. CSS stands for cascading style sheet, meaning it will start with the most important rules then move down to the lesser ones.</li>
		<li>Changing the background, foreground, and other things.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What I will learn:</h2>
	<p>There are several things to learn in CSS. The box model is a big part of CSS, and we haven't covered it all in class, yet.. I do believe Bootstrap is going to be a big part of the box model as well. Along with improving my skills with the box model, I wish to get better at using selectors. Specifically Group, Decendant, Child, Adjacent Sibling, General Sibling, ID, Class, and Universal selectors. <br><br>Also learning how to do things without looking anything up. I've been having a lot of trouble with syntax and correct order. The box model being moved around to where I want it is a pain as well.</p>
